# Implementation Plan: POC de Bot de WhatsApp Business

**Branch**: `001-whatsapp-business-bot-poc` | **Date**: 2026-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification for a client-presentable WhatsApp Business bot POC.

## Summary

Build a .NET 10 LTS solution with three projects: an ASP.NET Core administrative web
application (`WhatsAppBot.Admin`), an ASP.NET Core Web API (`WhatsAppBot.Api`), and shared
contracts (`WhatsAppBot.Shared`). The Admin is a thin server-rendered client of the API; the
API owns authentication, use-case orchestration, persistence, and integrations.

The API uses the mandated Middleware, Business, Persistence, Infrastructure, Integrations,
Models, and Helpers layers. SQL Server stored procedures are the only persistence interface.
Meta WhatsApp Cloud API and AI/media providers are accessed behind Integration contracts.
Persist inbound webhook events before acknowledging Meta, process them idempotently in a
background worker, and track outbound work/status independently from AI generation.

For the POC, use Meta Embedded Signup v4, OpenAI API for response generation, image analysis
and transcription, and FFmpeg to convert WhatsApp OGG/Opus voice media to an accepted
transcription format. The FAQ matcher is deterministic normalized phrase containment, ordered
by configured priority, not an NLP engine.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 10 LTS, latest supported 10.0.x servicing patch at build and
deployment time.

**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core Web API; ASP.NET Core Razor Pages for Admin;
RestSharp for Meta and OpenAI HTTP integrations; Microsoft.Data.SqlClient for stored
procedures; built-in dependency injection and logging; Swagger/OpenAPI; FFmpeg for audio
normalization; xUnit for tests.

**Storage**: SQL Server for administrators, integration/bot configuration, FAQ rules,
contacts, conversations, message metadata, webhook inbox/outbox, and transcripts. Local
Development uses SQL Server LocalDB instance `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`, database `WhatsAppBot`,
and Windows/Trusted Connection. Its configured connection string is
`Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=WhatsAppBot;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;`
in `appsettings.Development.json` (with the backslash escaped for JSON). LocalDB is not a
production-engine decision. Infrastructure owns connection/options binding and SqlClient/
DataSource configuration; Persistence owns repositories, data operations, and Stored
Procedures. Admin consumes only Api and never connects to LocalDB or SQL Server. Deployed
environments remain compatible with SQL Server and provide their connection through
environment-specific configuration/secret storage. Store original media in a private object
store behind a storage interface; persist only its reference and processing metadata in SQL
Server. User Secrets are for local secrets; production credentials belong in an approved
managed secret store.

**Testing**: xUnit unit tests for Business and matching rules; SQL integration tests for stored
procedures; API contract tests; Meta webhook signature/idempotency tests; external-integration
tests with HTTP stubs; opt-in end-to-end tests against a Meta test number and configured AI
provider.

**Target Platform**: ASP.NET Core 10 hosting environment with public HTTPS ingress for Meta
webhooks and a reachable SQL Server. Local Development uses `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`; deployed
environments use a SQL Server connection supplied through configuration. Hosting/cloud vendor
is not fixed by this plan.

**Project Type**: Three-project web solution: administrative web app, backend API, and shared
contracts.

**Performance Goals**: Persist and acknowledge valid Meta webhook deliveries promptly (target
under 2 seconds at p95, without waiting for media downloads or AI); process replies
asynchronously. Admin list/detail screens should be usable within 2 seconds at p95 for the
single-number POC and a demo-sized conversation history.

**Constraints**: Use only official Meta WhatsApp Business Platform / Cloud API; no WhatsApp Web,
scraping, or client simulation. Controllers and webhook handlers only validate transport
concerns and delegate. No SQL text in Business, Controllers, or Admin. External calls have
timeouts and cancellation; webhook delivery and outgoing message processing are idempotent.
Never log or expose access tokens, App Secret, Verify Token, AI keys, raw media, or sensitive
payloads. Respect WhatsApp customer opt-in, messaging-window and approved-template policy.
The FAQ feature is internal bot content, not a Meta message-template substitute.

**Scale/Scope**: One active WhatsApp integration and one Admin account for initial POC flows;
use IntegrationId as a relationship boundary so the data model can later support more
numbers/businesses without singleton-column redesign. No billing, campaigns, multi-company
administration, CRM, advanced permissions, or advanced reporting.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Constitution requirement | Plan decision | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Mission-driven, bounded POC | Three projects and only the requested demo journeys; no campaign/CRM features | PASS |
| Secure by default | Server-side secret references, webhook signature validation, input validation, no secrets in logs, private media store, and minimal retention | PASS, subject to retention approval before real customer data |
| Test-first quality | Unit, stored-procedure integration, API contract, webhook security/idempotency and external E2E checks planned | PASS |
| Observable operations | Structured logs, correlation IDs, processing/delivery states, and explicit failures | PASS |
| Simplicity/change control | Stored procedures and deterministic FAQ matching; no custom NLP or broker in POC | PASS |
| Official WhatsApp integration | Embedded Signup v4 and Cloud API only; Graph API isolated in Integrations | PASS |
| Business/Integrations boundary | Business owns use cases and policies; provider adapters remain behind interfaces | PASS |
| Admin/API boundary | Razor Pages communicates only with Api; no Admin SQL access or business rules | PASS |
| Future multi-number support | All WhatsApp-owned records reference IntegrationId; only one active integration is enabled by POC policy | PASS |
| Supported runtime | Use the explicitly requested .NET 10 LTS and latest supported 10.0.x servicing patch at build/deployment; verify lifecycle status before release. | PASS |

No architectural constitution rule is waived. Media/message retention must be approved before
use with real customer data; this plan proposes a configurable 30-day POC retention window for
stored conversation content and raw media.

```

`WhatsAppBot.Api.Models` contains internal domain/persistence models and transport-boundary
types; `WhatsAppBot.Shared` contains types exchanged between Admin and Api. Avoid duplicating
the same type in both projects. Each layer references inward: Controllers/Webhooks → Business
→ abstractions; Persistence, Infrastructure, and Integrations implement abstractions; Program
registers extensions. `AddBusiness()`, `AddPersistence()`, `AddInfrastructure()`, and
`AddIntegrations()` register their own services. Program only configures host, middleware,
authentication, authorization, endpoints, Swagger, and the four extensions.

### Request and Message Flows

**Admin**: Razor Pages sends requests to Api through a typed server-side HTTP client. It
contains presentation validation only, never business rules or direct SQL. Api authenticates
administrators and returns `ResponseE<T>` DTO contracts.

**Meta onboarding**: The Admin launches Meta's Embedded Signup v4 JS flow. It sends the
one-time authorization code and returned WABA ID / Phone Number ID to Api. Api delegates
exchange, phone registration, and WABA webhook subscription to the Meta integration. The
resulting customer business token is stored in the configured secret store; SQL stores only an
opaque secret reference and non-secret identifiers/status.

**Webhook receipt**: GET verifies `hub.verify_token` and returns the challenge only on a
constant-time match. POST validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` against the raw request body using
the App Secret, validates the event envelope, and asks Business to persist an idempotent
inbox event. Return 200 only after durable persistence. A hosted worker processes the persisted
event so slow media and AI work do not hold the webhook request open.

**Inbound processing**: Persist contact/message and establish conversation; check bot state;
for configured FAQ modes, normalize text (or the audio transcript) and compare against active
expressions; choose highest priority, tie-break by stable FAQ ID. On no match, invoke AI only
for fallback or AI-only mode. `FaqOnly` never invokes AI and records a no-match without reply;
`FaqThenAi` is the default and invokes AI only on a FAQ miss; `AiOnly` skips FAQ lookup.
These rules apply equally to text and audio transcripts. Before enqueueing any outbound text,
Business checks the current WhatsApp messaging-window and template policy through an Integration
port. The POC demo is limited to customer-initiated conversations within the permitted customer
service window. If an official template is required, FAQ/AI content is not sent as a substitute;
the inbound processing result records a visible no-reply/policy outcome. Image messages are
passed to vision in AI-enabled modes. Create an outbound pending message/outbox item only after
policy approval, send via Meta adapter, then reconcile `wamid` and sent/delivered/read/failed
status webhooks. Duplicates do not create duplicate messages or replies.

**Admin experiences**: Login; dashboard; WhatsApp connection/status and bot state/mode;
frequent response CRUD; conversation list and detail timeline with direction/type/status,
transcription, secure image access, and whether the response source is FAQ or AI.

## Constitution Check (Post-Design)

The design preserves the official Meta-only integration requirement, keeps all Graph API,
OpenAI, transcription, and image-analysis calls behind Integrations adapters, assigns
orchestration to Business, and isolates SQL Server/stored procedures in Persistence. Admin is a
thin API consumer. Credentials are stored as secure references and never returned in DTOs.
Webhook events, messages, and outbound sends are idempotent and observable. No custom NLP,
unofficial WhatsApp library, or unnecessary broker is introduced.

**Post-design result**: PASS for architecture and runtime target. Release remains conditional on
Meta app access/review, and approved retention/consent policy.

## Dependencies and External Configuration

### Meta Developers and WhatsApp Business prerequisites

- Meta Developer account and an application enabled for WhatsApp Business Platform / Cloud API.
- Create a Facebook Login for Business configuration with **Embedded Signup v4**, configured
  for Cloud API only; do not integrate v2, which Meta says is deprecated on 2026-10-15.
- Meta business portfolio, WABA, business phone number eligible for Cloud API, and an Admin
  who can authorize/select the assets. For an existing WhatsApp Business App number, validate
  the applicable Embedded Signup coexistence flow before onboarding.
- Configure HTTPS callback/webhook URL, webhook verify token, subscribe to `messages` and
  status updates, and subscribe the application to the connected WABA.
- Request the Cloud API permissions `whatsapp_business_management` and
  `whatsapp_business_messaging`. Complete applicable App Review / Advanced Access, business
  verification, and provider onboarding requirements before onboarding a customer WABA.
- Confirm whether the organization operates as a direct developer, Tech Provider, or Solution
  Partner; token type, App Review, customer onboarding, and payment/credit-line requirements
  depend on this status. The POC does not assume partner credit-line privileges.
- Confirm customer opt-in and WhatsApp conversation-window/template rules. FAQ answers and AI
  output are not approved Meta templates and cannot bypass those rules.

### Credentials and provider configuration

- **Meta**: App ID, App Secret, Facebook Login for Business configuration ID, webhook Verify
  Token, Graph API version, and the business access token exchanged server-to-server from the
  one-time Embedded Signup code. Never send the App Secret or access token to Admin/browser.
- **Secret storage**: `.NET User Secrets` locally; production uses an approved managed secret
  store. Store references in SQL, not secret values. If hosted in Azure, use Azure Key Vault;
  otherwise supply a conforming secret-store adapter. Verify Token is a secret too.
- **OpenAI** (selected POC provider): API key, configured text/vision model, transcription
  model, request timeout, and usage budget/limits. Keep model identifiers configurable.
- **SQL Server**: connection string from environment-specific configuration (Development
  LocalDB in `appsettings.Development.json`; deployed SQL Server settings from that
  environment's configuration/secret store), least-privilege service identity, Stored
  Procedures and TVP type for FAQ expression updates.
- **Development SQL Server**: LocalDB `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB`, database `WhatsAppBot`,
  Windows/Trusted Connection. Configure `ConnectionStrings:WhatsAppBot` in
  `appsettings.Development.json` as
  `Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=WhatsAppBot;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;`.
  Never embed connection strings in Business, Controllers, or repository classes.
- **SQL initialization**: clean-install scripts create the database, tables, relationships,
  indexes, Stored Procedures, and only required initial data on LocalDB. Infrastructure
  supplies configured SQL Server connection resources; Persistence alone executes data
  operations and Stored Procedures. LocalDB is Development-only and is not assumed in
  production.
- **Media storage**: private bucket/container, server-side credentials, maximum media size,
  retention/expiry and deletion policy. Do not use a public URL or persist Meta's temporary
  media URL as the durable record.
- **Admin**: initial administrator provisioning path, HTTPS origin, cookie protection keys,
  JWT signing key held in a secret store, and allowed origins/CSRF configuration.
- **Audio normalization**: deploy a pinned, patched FFmpeg binary or image package. WhatsApp
  voice notes are commonly OGG/Opus; OpenAI transcription currently documents mp3, mp4, mpeg,
  mpga, m4a, wav and webm (25 MB max), not OGG. Convert only when required; delete temporary
  media after the provider call.

### External-service dependencies and risks

| Dependency | Real external service needed for | Main risk / mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Meta Embedded Signup + Graph Cloud API | Real onboarding, number registration, inbound/outbound messages, media retrieval and status webhooks | App review/permissions, account eligibility, messaging policy, rate/quality/throughput limits and version changes; isolate adapter, pin/configure Graph version and use a Meta test number first |
| OpenAI API | Live generated text, audio transcription and image understanding | Cost, latency, data-processing approval, rate limits, unsupported codec/size, model changes; configurable models, timeouts, usage caps, minimal media transmission, visible failure states |
| SQL Server | Persisting settings, FAQ rules, conversations, events and statuses | Connectivity/permissions/procedure drift; integration-test every procedure and use explicit transactions |
| Private media/object store | Retaining images/audio for processing and conversation display | Privacy, storage cost and public leakage; private access, short-lived authorized reads, retention cleanup and no public links |
| FFmpeg | Converting OGG/Opus voice note to supported transcription format | Native dependency, deployment/patching and untrusted media; size/time limits, isolated process, no shell interpolation, bounded resources, ephemeral files |

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. Confirm the current .NET 10 LTS patch at project setup. Obtain Meta access, opt-in/messaging,
   AI data-processing, and retention approvals before their respective live-service or real-data
   validation gates; these approvals do not block local Admin, SQL, FAQ, and mode development.
2. Create solution/projects, dependency directions, DI extension methods, validated Options,
   secure configuration providers, global exception middleware, structured logs and trace IDs.
3. Define SQL schema, stored procedures, least-privilege database identity and persistence
   tests; securely bootstrap the first administrator through a one-time command that delegates
   to Business, then implement Admin login/session and the typed Admin-to-Api client.
4. Implement bot configuration (enabled state and three modes) and frequent-response CRUD,
   matching and Admin screens. Validate these locally against SQL before any Meta or AI setup.
5. Configure Meta Embedded Signup v4 and implement server-side code exchange, number
   registration, token references, WABA subscription and truthful connection status.
6. Implement webhook verification/signature validation, durable idempotent inbox and status
   ingestion. Test with signed fixtures before enabling the worker for real messages.
7. Implement text ingestion and conversation/message persistence first. Verify `FaqOnly`
   matching/no-reply and `FaqThenAi` matching locally using a fake sender/provider; then enable
   the real Meta sender and OpenAI fallback behind their interfaces.
8. Enforce the WhatsApp customer-service window and template policy before every send. For the
   POC, demonstrate only customer-initiated conversations in the permitted window; never
   substitute a configured or AI response for an official template.
9. Implement Admin conversation list/detail and verify a complete text → FAQ / AI reply →
   persisted visible conversation journey.
10. Only after the text journey is validated, add audio download/transcription/mode evaluation,
    then image download/analysis/reply. Add private media storage, bounds and cleanup.
11. Complete the final dashboard summary, security/resilience checks, timed SC-006 scenario,
    and end-to-end demo/release validation with consented test data.

**Structure Decision**: Use exactly three deployable solution projects named as requested.
Admin is a Razor Pages API client; Api is the composition root and owns the seven mandated
layers; Shared carries public DTOs/contracts/enums only. Tests are separate test projects,
not additional production solution layers.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations or unnecessary architectural projects are proposed. A hosted worker
and durable inbox/outbox are required to decouple webhook acknowledgement from slow AI/media
processing and prevent duplicate replies; SQL Server is reused as the durable work store, so
the POC does not add a broker.

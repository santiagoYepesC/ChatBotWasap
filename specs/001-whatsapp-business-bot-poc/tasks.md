# Tasks: POC de Bot de WhatsApp Business

**Input**: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`,
`contracts/openapi.yaml`, and `quickstart.md` in this feature directory.

**Order**: Implement and validate a local Admin/configuration/FAQ slice first; then connect
Meta, receive webhooks, deliver the text+FAQ path, enable AI fallback, and show conversations.
Only after that working vertical slice add audio, photographs, the final dashboard, and
cross-cutting release hardening.

**Task format**: Every task has an ID, explicit `Dependencies`, expected file path(s), and
an observable completion condition. `[P]` means the task can proceed concurrently with other
ready `[P]` tasks because it does not share their output files.

## Phase 1: Setup — Solution and Host

- [X] T001 Create `WhatsAppBot.sln` at repository root targeting .NET 10 LTS; Dependencies: None; done when the solution file exists and `dotnet sln WhatsAppBot.sln list` succeeds.
- [X] T002 Create the `src/WhatsAppBot.Admin`, `src/WhatsAppBot.Api`, and `src/WhatsAppBot.Shared` projects targeting `net10.0`; Dependencies: T001; done when each project builds independently.
- [X] T003 Configure references so Admin and Api consume Shared, Admin has no SQL dependency/configuration, and Api does not reference Admin in the three `.csproj` files; Dependencies: T002; done when the project-reference graph complies with `plan.md`.
- [X] T004 [P] Define validated configuration Options types for API, Meta, SQL, AI, media storage, and Admin API URL in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Infrastructure/Options/` and `src/WhatsAppBot.Admin/Configuration/`; include the SQL connection name `ConnectionStrings:WhatsAppBot` and support Development LocalDB `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` / `WhatsAppBot` / Windows Trusted Connection; Dependencies: T002; done when types define configuration shape/validation only, do not embed connection strings or provider secret values, and contain no configuration-provider setup.
- [X] T005 [P] Add User Secrets identifiers to `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/WhatsAppBot.Api.csproj` and `src/WhatsAppBot.Admin/WhatsAppBot.Admin.csproj` and document the local secret key names in `specs/001-whatsapp-business-bot-poc/quickstart.md`; Dependencies: T002; done when Api's secret keys are stored only in User Secrets and Admin holds only its non-secret Api URL.
- [X] T006 Add required ASP.NET Core, RestSharp, SqlClient, and Swagger/OpenAPI packages to `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/WhatsAppBot.Api.csproj` and `src/WhatsAppBot.Admin/WhatsAppBot.Admin.csproj`; Dependencies: T002, T005; done when restore succeeds and each dependency is only in the project that consumes it.
- [X] T007 Configure development-only Swagger/OpenAPI and contract discovery in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Program.cs`; Dependencies: T006; done when the API document is reachable only in the intended Development environment.
- [X] T008 Bind and validate Options and configure sources in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Program.cs`, `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Infrastructure/Extensions/`, `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/appsettings.Development.json`, and `src/WhatsAppBot.Admin/Program.cs`; Dependencies: T004, T005, T006, T007; done when Infrastructure binds `ConnectionStrings:WhatsAppBot` and supplies SQL connection resources, Development uses `Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=WhatsAppBot;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;`, deployed environments can provide a SQL Server connection independently, User Secrets load in Development, environment variables load when deployed, HTTPS is configured, and invalid required settings fail explicitly.
- [X] T009 Configure structured logging, trace IDs, and secret/payload redaction in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Program.cs`; Dependencies: T008; done when logs are traceable and omit credentials and complete webhook/media bodies.

## Phase 2: Foundational — Architecture, Persistence, and Secure Admin Access

**Purpose**: Provide the blocking foundation for local Admin/configuration/FAQ work. Media
provider/retention approval in T020 is a media-only gate and does not block local FAQ work,
Meta onboarding, or text processing.

- [X] T010 Create API layer structure and namespace boundaries for Middleware, Business, Persistence, Infrastructure, Integrations, Models, and Helpers under `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/`; Dependencies: T002; done when all seven required layers exist as planned.

- [X] T015 [P] Add shared connection, bot mode, direction, message/media, processing/delivery, conversation, and reply-source enums in `src/WhatsAppBot.Shared/Enums/`; Dependencies: T002; done when enum values match the data model and OpenAPI.
- [X] T016 Add internal entity and request/response/contract models in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Models/`; Dependencies: T014, T015; done when persistence/domain models are distinct from externally shared DTOs and cover the planned entities.
- [X] T017 Add public request/response DTOs with `DTO` suffix in `src/WhatsAppBot.Shared/DTOs/`, `Requests/`, and `Responses/`; Dependencies: T014, T015; done when API-facing models cover login, bot, FAQ, integration, messages (including allowlisted no-reply `outcomeCode`), and conversations without credential fields.
- [X] T018 Implement global exception handling and safe `ResponseE<T>` mapping in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Middleware/GlobalExceptionMiddleware.cs`; Dependencies: T013, T014; done when an unhandled exception produces a traceable safe failure, not stack or provider details.

- [ ] T020 Obtain owner approval for private media storage provider and retention duration and record approved values in `specs/001-whatsapp-business-bot-poc/quickstart.md`; Dependencies: T005; done when both release inputs are explicit before real customer media is processed.
- [ ] T021 Implement the Infrastructure secret-store adapter in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Infrastructure/Security/`; Dependencies: T004, T010, T011; done when Business/Integrations resolve credentials only through a secret-store interface and persistence stores references rather than secret values.
- [X] T022 Create a clean-install LocalDB database bootstrap and initial SQL Server schema in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Persistence/StoredProcedures/Schema/000_CreateDatabase.sql`, `001_InitialSchema.sql`, and `scripts/sql/Initialize-DevelopmentDatabase.ps1`; Dependencies: T016; done when the scripts create `WhatsAppBot` on `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` using Windows authentication, then create Administrator, WhatsAppIntegration, BotConfiguration, FAQ, Contact, Conversation, Message, MediaAttachment, Transcript, WebhookInboxEvent, and MessageOutbox with keys, nullable-before-signup identifiers, UTC audit columns, one-active-number invariant, and default NotConnected/bot-disabled/FaqThenAi configuration, and the initializer applies numbered schema/procedure/required seed scripts in deterministic order while failing on any SQL error.
- [X] T023 Add required unique/query indexes and constraints in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Persistence/StoredProcedures/Schema/002_IndexesAndConstraints.sql`; Dependencies: T022; done when FAQ lookup, contact, phone, provider-message idempotency, inbox/outbox, conversation listing, and chronology queries have the modeled indexes.
- [X] T024 Add the FAQ expression TVP type in `src/WhatsAppBot.Api/Persistence/StoredProcedures/Schema/003_TableTypes.sql`; Dependencies: T022; done when FAQ create/update can atomically replace expression sets using the declared SQL type.

## Dependency Order and Incremental Checkpoints

1. **Admin foundation**: T001-T032. The first administrator is securely bootstrapped; Admin
   authenticates through Api and has no SQL access.
2. **Bot configuration and FAQs**: T033-T050. This increment is testable locally with SQL;
   it proves all three modes and deterministic FAQ CRUD/matching before external services.
3. **Meta connection**: T051-T059. Complete official Embedded Signup and verify a single
   connected test number.
4. **Webhook and text**: T060-T078. First prove FAQ hit/no-match behavior with stubs and real
   customer-initiated in-window test messages; AI is called only in `FaqThenAi` on a miss or
   directly in `AiOnly`.
5. **Conversation visibility**: T079-T082. Inspect the working text interaction in Admin.
6. **Audio, then photography**: T083-T087, then T088-T091. Each extends the already-tested
   message and conversation flow; audio transcripts use exactly the text response-mode rules.
7. **Dashboard and final gates**: T092-T098. Finish UI summary, security/resilience, timed
   SC-006 proof, and complete demo only after the vertical slices are working.

The media-provider/retention decision and private media adapter are required before processing
real audio/photo data; they do not block earlier local Admin, FAQ, Meta connection, webhook, or
text-only increments.

The Admin, SQL, FAQ, mode, and matcher increments can be tested without Meta/OpenAI credentials.
The Meta-connected text increment uses Meta test assets; the OpenAI service is required only
for the fallback/AI-only and multimodal scenarios. No task adds multi-company, simultaneous
numbers, billing, CRM, campaigns, advanced reporting, or complex roles.

## Parallel Opportunities

- T004 and T005 use different configuration files after projects exist.
- T014 and T015 create independent Shared response and enum files.
- T038, T039, and T040 target separate test files after the foundation is ready.
- T051 and T060 target different test suites/contracts.
- T069 can be authored with the FAQ matcher/mode tests because the test files are separate.
- T083 and T088 are separate media adapter test suites; they may be prepared in parallel after
  media interfaces are stable, though implementation phases remain audio then photography.
- T094 can proceed independently of the SC-006 documentation task T093 after its prerequisites.
- LocalDB is the Development-only target for T022/T026/T098; deployment configuration remains
  SQL Server-compatible and is not coupled to the LocalDB instance.

## Validation Summary

- **Total tasks**: 98, sequential IDs T001-T098.
- **Dependencies**: Explicit on every task; `None` is stated where there is no prerequisite.
- **Parallel tasks**: Only tasks with separate files and satisfied prerequisites are marked
  `[P]`; the task list and opportunities section identify their boundaries.
- **Scope**: One active number; no multi-company, simultaneous numbers, billing, CRM, campaigns,
  advanced reporting, complex permissions, or Meta template authoring/sending.
